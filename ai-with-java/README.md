Prompt: Can you help in creating the excel read/write code for java?
Certainly! I can help you with reading from and writing to Excel files using Java. To accomplish this, you'll need to use a library that provides Excel-related functionality. One popular library for this purpose is Apache POI. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read from and write to an Excel file using Apache POI:

Make sure you have the Apache POI library (poi-ooxml) added to your project's dependencies before running this code. You can download the library from the Apache POI website (https://poi.apache.org/).

In this example, the code reads from an existing Excel file and prints the data to the console. Then it creates a new Excel file and writes some data to it. You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements.

Remember to replace `"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx"` with the actual file path you want to read from or write to.

I hope this helps you get started with Excel read/write operations in Java! Let me know if you have any further questions.
