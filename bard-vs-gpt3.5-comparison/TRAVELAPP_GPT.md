# Travel Booking App - ChatGPT

# Prompt 1
We are trying to create a travel booking application for our client and want to propose the detailed architecture along with the code for the same, Can you help in generating high level Epics, features and stories followed by architecture and actual code in java using spring boot

# Prompt 1 Response:

Certainly! I can help you generate high-level epics, features, and stories for a travel booking application, followed by an architecture overview and sample code in Java using Spring Boot. Please keep in mind that the code provided here is a simplified example and may not cover all aspects of a fully functional production-ready application. Consider it as a starting point for your implementation. Let's get started!

## Epics, Features, and Stories

### Epic 1: User Authentication and Registration
- Feature 1: User Registration
  - Story 1: As a new user, I want to be able to create an account with my personal information.
  - Story 2: As a new user, I want to receive a confirmation email to verify my account.
- Feature 2: User Login
  - Story 1: As a registered user, I want to be able to log in using my credentials.
  - Story 2: As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.

### Epic 2: Search and Booking Flights
- Feature 1: Flight Search

  - Story 2: As a user, I want to provide passenger details and select additional services (e.g., seat selection, meal preferences) during the booking process.
  - Story 3: As a user, I want to make a payment to confirm the flight booking.

### Epic 3: Hotel Search and Booking
- Feature 1: Hotel Search
  - Story 1: As a user, I want to search for hotels by specifying the destination, check-in date, and check-out date.
  - Story 2: As a user, I want to filter hotel search results based on price, star ratings, amenities, and user ratings.
- Feature 2: Hotel Booking

  - Story 2: As a user, I want to provide guest details and select room preferences during the booking process.
  - Story 3: As a user, I want to make a payment to confirm the hotel booking.

### Epic 4: User Profile and Booking Management
- Feature 1: User Profile Management
  - Story 1: As a user, I want to view and update my profile information.
  - Story 2: As a user, I want to view my booking history and upcoming trips.
- Feature 2: Booking Management
  - Story 1: As a user, I want to cancel or modify my flight or hotel bookings.
  - Story 2: As an admin, I want to view and manage all user bookings.

## Architecture Overview
The proposed architecture for the travel booking application will follow a microservices-based approach. It will consist of the following key components:

- **Frontend**: A user interface that allows users to interact with the application.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the single entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- **Flight Service**: Manages flight-related operations such as searching for flights, retrieving flight details, and making bookings.
- **Hotel Service**: Manages hotel-related operations such as searching for hotels, retrieving hotel

 details, and making bookings.
- **User Service**: Handles user profile management, booking history, and user-related operations.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with a payment gateway to handle payment transactions.

The services communicate with each other through APIs or message queues. They are independently deployable and scalable.

## Sample Code

Here's a simplified example of the code structure using Spring Boot:

### Authentication Service

```java
// UserRegistrationController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/auth")
public class UserRegistrationController {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<?> registerUser(@RequestBody UserRegistrationRequest request) {
        // Validate request

        User registeredUser = userService.registerUser(request);
        // Generate and send confirmation email

        return ResponseEntity.ok("User registered successfully");
    }
}

// User.java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;

    private String email;

    private String password;

    // Getters and setters
}

// UserService.java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public User registerUser(UserRegistrationRequest request) {
        // Create and save a new User entity

        return savedUser;
    }
}

// UserRepository.java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    User findByUsername(String username);
    User findByEmail(String email);
}
```

### Flight Service

```java
// FlightSearchController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/flights")
public class FlightSearchController {

    @Autowired
    private FlightService flightService;

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public ResponseEntity<?> searchFlights(@RequestParam("origin") String origin,
                                           @RequestParam("destination") String destination,
                                           @RequestParam("date") LocalDate date) {
        // Validate request

        List<Flight> flights = flightService.searchFlights(origin, destination, date);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(flights);
    }
}

// Flight.java
public class Flight {

    private String id;

    private String airline;

    private LocalDateTime departureTime;

    private LocalDateTime arrivalTime;

    private BigDecimal price;

    // Getters and setters
}

// FlightService.java
@Service
public class FlightService {

    public List<Flight> searchFlights(String origin, String destination, LocalDate date) {
        // Perform flight search based on input parameters

        return flights;
    }
}
```

### Hotel Service

```java
// HotelSearchController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/hotels")
public class HotelSearchController {

    @Autowired
    private HotelService hotelService;

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public ResponseEntity<?> searchHotels(@RequestParam("destination") String destination,
                                          @RequestParam("checkInDate") LocalDate checkInDate,
                                          @RequestParam("checkOutDate") LocalDate checkOutDate) {
        // Validate request

        List<Hotel> hotels = hotelService.searchHotels(destination, checkInDate, checkOutDate);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(hotels);
    }
}

// Hotel.java
public class Hotel {

    private String id;

    private String name;

    private String address;

    private BigDecimal price;

    private int starRating;

    // Getters and setters
}

// HotelService.java
@Service
public class HotelService {

    public List<Hotel> searchHotels(String destination, LocalDate checkInDate, LocalDate checkOutDate) {
        // Perform hotel search based on input parameters

        return hotels;
    }
}
```

Please note that this is just a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you would have additional validations, error handling, database configurations, security measures, and integration with external services for payments

 and email confirmation.

I hope this gives you a good starting point for your travel booking application. Remember to adapt and expand on this code according to your specific requirements.
