**Architecture**

The architecture for your travel booking application will be a three-tier architecture, with a web tier, an application tier, and a data tier.

* **Web tier**
    * The web tier will be responsible for handling user requests and displaying the application's user interface.
    * The web tier will be implemented using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.
* **Application tier**
    * The application tier will be responsible for processing user requests and performing business logic.
    * The application tier will be implemented using Spring Boot and Java.
* **Data tier**
    * The data tier will be responsible for storing data and retrieving data for the application tier.
    * The data tier will be implemented using MySQL.

**Code**

The code for your travel booking application will be written in Java and will be implemented using Spring Boot.

Here is an example of a controller class that will be used to handle user requests:

```
@RestController
public class FlightController {

    @Autowired
    private FlightService flightService;

    @GetMapping("/flights")
    public List<Flight> getAllFlights() {
        return flightService.getAllFlights();
    }

    @PostMapping("/flights")
    public Flight bookFlight(@RequestBody Flight flight) {
        return flightService.bookFlight(flight);
    }

}
```

Here is an example of a service class that will be used to perform business logic:

```
public class FlightService {

    private FlightRepository flightRepository;

    public FlightService(FlightRepository flightRepository) {
        this.flightRepository = flightRepository;
    }

    public List<Flight> getAllFlights() {
        return flightRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Flight bookFlight(Flight flight) {
        flightRepository.save(flight);
        return flight;
    }

}
```

I hope this helps!
